**Nice-to-haves for cash_register.py:

*Require the cashier to login. (would need to store passwords somewhere - consider hash() function)
*Number the items in a transaction and allow the cashier to remove an item before calculating total.
*Store more data in receipts file.
*Consider error checking for anomalous scenarios.
*Add additional features you think could be useful.
